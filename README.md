# Dragonfly44_SFH

This repository contains all the data used to analyze the star formation history (SFH) of Dragonfly 44 (DF44) as discussed in Webb+2022 (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.3318W/abstract) based on high-S/N and high-resolution rest-frame optical KCWI spectroscopy and NUV--NIR photometry.

Notebooks are provided to generate the figures shown in Webb+2022
> notebooks/Webb20202_figures/*

Note that some figures have slight errors, as noted in notebooks/Webb20202_figures/errata.txt. This errors have been corrected in the notebooks shared here.

In progress:
- Notebooks where it is convenient to compare results beyond that shown in Webb+2022
